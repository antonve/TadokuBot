"""Help cog: the ``/tadokubot`` and ``/tadokutag`` commands + the online announcement.

``/tadokubot`` shows everyone a grouped list of the bot's commands (general vs
Manage-Server-only); ``/tadokutag`` explains which tadoku.app tag to put on a log
so its cover (or link) shows on the log-feed card. When the bot first connects,
it also posts a short "I'm online — run /tadokubot" pointer to each server's
existing bot channel (its log feed channel, or failing that its alerts channel),
so members discover the command list without an admin having to advertise it.
