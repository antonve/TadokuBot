"""Claims cog: link Discord users to their tadoku.app usernames.

Once a member is "claimed" to a tadoku display name, the bot knows which Discord
user is which contest participant. The mapping is per-server and two-way unique:
each member may claim at most one username, and each username may be claimed by
at most one member.

Commands:
  * ``/claim username`` -- a member links themselves to a contest participant.
  * ``/unclaim``        -- a member drops their own claim.
  * ``/unclaimedlist``  -- list contest participants nobody has claimed yet.
  * ``/autoclaim``      -- (admin) bulk-link every participant to the Discord
    member of the same name.

Matching (and uniqueness) is case/whitespace-insensitive, reusing the
leaderboard cog's ``_normalize_name`` so it agrees with the leaderboard. Contest
data is fetched live from tadoku.app via the leaderboard cog's helpers; only the
claim map is persisted (in ``lib.config_store``).
