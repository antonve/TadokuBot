"""Leaderboard cog: the ``/leaderboard``, ``/weeklyleaderboard`` and
``/monthlyleaderboard`` commands.

They all resolve which contest this server should show (a pinned one, or the
latest official as a fallback) and render results as Discord embeds with medal
emoji for the top three. ``/leaderboard`` reads the contest's cumulative
ranking; ``/weeklyleaderboard`` and ``/monthlyleaderboard`` instead
tally raw logs over a window (the last 7 days, or the current calendar month) to
build the rolling/period rankings the API doesn't expose directly.

When a server has the shame setting on (the default; toggled via ``/shame``),
``/weeklyleaderboard`` and ``/monthlyleaderboard`` also append a "shame"
call-out naming anyone who has points in the contest overall but logged nothing
in that command's window.
